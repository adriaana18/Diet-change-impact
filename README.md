# Diet-change-impact
This is a basic data handling, inspection and statistical project in R to examine a given dataset for a health company.

#The context
The company has developed an improvement to its regular diet plan: the biggest change is excluding chocolate entirely. They want to know whether this change to the plan has been effective at helping people to lose weight. They have tracked a sample of their members, some of whom remained on the regular diet plan, and some who trialled the no chocolate diet. Their weight (in kg) was recorded at the beginning and end of the trial, and measurements were also taken for a number of other potential factors. This includes their height (in cm), age, biological sex, their score on an impulsivity test and their IQ. 

The project explores the data and aims to answer the company's inquiry of whether the change has been effective. This is done with exploratory data analysis, visualisations using ggplot, linear regression models and t-testing the difference in means between two groups. 

The code is commented along with the inisghts from the data and the motivations for applying certain techniques.
